**üîç Steps / Workflow**

1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
    - Handled 5K+ missing values and outliers  
    - Standardized and normalized data formats

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
    - Analyzed sales trends across time, store type, and promotions  
    - Built visualizations to uncover seasonal and regional patterns  
3. Feature Engineering   
    - Created 20+ new features (time-based, store-specific, competition effects)   
4. Model Development  
    - Trained Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models  
    - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy  
5. Model Evaluation  
    - Achieved ~89% prediction accuracy (RMSPE ‚âà 0.11)  
    - Improved forecasting reliability by 15% compared to baseline
