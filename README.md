**üîç Steps / Workflow**

1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
    Collected historical sales data for Rossmann stores, including competitor details, holiday details, customer details, and daily sales detail Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis ensuring data integrity. Handled missing values and outliers to improve the quality of the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
    Conducted in-depth EDA to extract valuable insights from the data set by exploring univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships. Generated insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data. Extracted meaningful insights to inform future decision-making in the machine learning pipeline. Statistical tests are performed to validate assumptions about the data and relationships between variables. These tests provide evidence for or against hypothetical statements about sales behavior.
   
3. Feature Engineering   
    Engineered new features, including PromoDuration and Competition Distance, to capture essential information. Addressed multicollinearity among independent variables using variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis. Detected and managed outliers using the winsorizing technique. Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables for compatibility with machine learning algorithms. Employed various transformation techniques to achieve a normal distribution of data.
   
4. Model Selection, Training and Hyperparamaters Tuning   
   Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. Implement multiple machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forest with regression techniques Evaluated model performance using metrics such as R-squared score, means square error, and root mean square error Employed regularization techniques, including Lasso, Ridge, to enhance model performance.

**üéâ Result**   
- After thorough experimentation with various machine learning the XGBoost model emerged as the top-performing model for sales prediction. It achieved an impressive R2 score of around 97.5% on the training data and maintained 95% on the test dataset.
- The model displayed lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values compared to other models, indicating superior predictive accuracy. Consistent performance across multiple evaluation metrics, including R2 score, MSE, and RMSE, suggests robust generalization.
- Residuals analysis revealed well-behaved residuals with mean and median values close to zero, affirming the model's ability to capture underlying data patterns effectively. This project showcases the effective utilization of data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world forecasting problem. The insights gained from the analysis provide valuable information for decision-making within the retail industry.
